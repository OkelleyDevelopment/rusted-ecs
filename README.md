# Rusted ECS

Author(s): Nicholas O'Kelley

Date Published: 2022-08-22

## Motivation

In order to get a better idea of how game engines work, in particular engines
like Amethyst or Bevy, I have been researching how ECS architectures work. This
lead to this project where we implement a minimal setup.

## Project Execution

This is a _super minimal implementation_ and is not intended for anything
other than to help others learn how ECS's work.

To run this project:

```
cargo run
```
